# Overview

I have always wanted to create my own game, whether it be a simple one that can be completed in 5-10 minutes, or a complex one that has hours worth of playable value. This game was created to help give me a basic understanding of game development; how to load images, how to utilize sprite sheets, how to create movement, etc...

The platformer game I created is a basic outline for what I wish to do in the future. The premise of the game is that you're just a standard street cat that is exploring the wide and open world. Currently you're only spawned in a simple world and are only able to move left and right, but there is more to come in the future.
