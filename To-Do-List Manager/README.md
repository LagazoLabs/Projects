## Development Environment
### C++
The C++ language is an object-oriented language that is used for embedded and application development. It is based on the C language. C++ requires the use of a compiler and linker, which are operating systemâ€“ and processor-specific. C++ includes the Standard Template Library (STL), which provides support for data structures and threading.
#### Vector Library
The vector library in C++ adds what is known as vectors. Vectors are simmilar to arrays, however, unlike arrays, vectors are more flexible and do not have a fixed size. This makes values in these vectors easier to acesss and modify. For this program, this library is used due to the limitations that standard arrays in C++ have. 
### Visual Studio 2022
Visual Studio is an integrated development environment developed by Microsoft. It is used to develop computer programs including websites, web apps, web services, and mobile apps.

## Future Work
- Allow the program and users to import tasks into the the list.
- Allow the program to export to-do lists.
- Allow the user to create different to-do lists and switch between them.
