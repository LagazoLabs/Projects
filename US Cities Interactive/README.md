# Overview

This interactive is meant to help better understand the general basics of GIS Mapping. However, it is also meant to help gauge interest in the field. I have always been interested in GIS and the various ways that data can be visualized through the use of maps. This helps understand the world around us and to make good decisions. 

The data I originally wanted to work with was U.S. Election Data and plotting it onto an interactive map. However, the file was way too large to be used with what I was able to use. Then I moved onto wanting to use air quality data, however, it was incompatible with ArcGIS, so I downscaled once again to data about U.S cities.

Nothing else too special about it besides data about 109k cities and towns from all 50 states, DC, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. Also including variables like household income, population, population density, etc...

# Development Environment
## ArcGIS
Web-based mapping platform to make interactive 2D and 3D maps, visualize data, and share results. Designed for personal, non-commercial projects and learning.
## Arcade
A flexible expression language that allows you to work with data in real time in ArcGIS. You can use Arcade to style and label your map, create informative pop-ups, and perform field calculations on your data.
## HTML
HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content.
## CSS
A style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.
## VS Code
An integrated development environment developed by Microsoft that features support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring.
